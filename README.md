# RPi Example Code
Example Python code for building RPi-controlled robotic systems

These python files have been compiled / developed by the Neurobionics Lab and are provided for convenience. They showcase some examples of controller structures for wearable robots (MIT_Knee_Complex_State_Machine) and driver libraries for common ICs (LS7366R quadrature encoder counter, etc.). Please feel free to use them in your project but note that some files are written in Python 2.X and may not run on the RPi Image.
